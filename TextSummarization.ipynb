    " text summarization. This notebook is the data loading and model training of this application. The GUI app is available in the release page. There are many steps towards implemeting this project. However, the main one is the model structure. In this type of applications, the input and output are both sequences. These types of models are called **Seq2Seq** models. More on that in the model creation part.\n",
